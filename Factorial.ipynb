    "The algorithm being used is:\n",
    "    <ol><li> The function expects to take in an integer n, and assigns the value to a new int variable called fac\n",
    "    <li>It then creates a while loop where n is decremented, then multipled by fac. It does this until n reaches 1, then exits the loop.\n",
    "    <li>Then it returns the value of fac as an int\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 1: with n>0, the while loop would run until n=1, and then as n was being decremented within the loop, fac was being multiplied by 0, which made the entire factorial output 0. We fixed this by changing the loop to run until n>1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 2: factorial of 0 was being otuput as 0 because fac was not being multipled by anything (as the while loop wouldn't execut), and was assigned the value of n in the beginning. We changed this by adding an if, reassigning fac to =1 if n==0."
